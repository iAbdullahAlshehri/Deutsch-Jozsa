# Quantum Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm Implementation with Qiskit
Welcome to the Quantum Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm repository! Explore this Python implementation using Qiskit to efficiently determine whether a given Boolean function is constant or balanced. Witness quantum computing's exponential advantage over classical approaches for this problem.


## Difference Between Deutsch Algorithm and Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm:

The Deutsch algorithm focuses on determining the nature of a Boolean function for a single input, distinguishing between constant and balanced functions.

In contrast, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm extends this concept to determine the nature of the Boolean function for all possible inputs, making it a more generalized and powerful algorithm. It identifies whether the function is constant or balanced across its entire domain, showcasing the full potential of quantum computing.
